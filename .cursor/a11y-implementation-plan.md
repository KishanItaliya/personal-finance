# Accessibility Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to implementing accessibility in our Personal Finance Dashboard.

## Phase 1: Assessment and Setup (1-2 weeks)

### Initial Audit
- [x] Create accessibility testing script (`scripts/a11y-test.js`)
- [x] Document manual testing procedures (`.cursor/a11y-manual-testing.md`)
- [ ] Run automated tests on key pages
- [ ] Conduct manual assessment using screen readers and keyboard
- [ ] Document all issues in GitHub issues with "a11y" label

### Setup Development Environment
- [x] Add required dependencies (`.cursor/a11y-dependencies.json`)
- [ ] Install eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y for linting
- [ ] Configure axe-core for development testing
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for accessibility checks

### Create Base Components
- [x] Skip link component (`components/a11y/SkipLink.tsx`)
- [x] Screen reader text component (`components/a11y/ScreenReaderText.tsx`)
- [x] Form field component (`components/a11y/FormField.tsx`)
- [x] Modal dialog component (`components/a11y/AccessibleModal.tsx`)
- [x] Create keyboard navigation utilities

## Phase 2: Implementation (2-4 weeks)

### Navigation and Structure
- [ ] Add proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- [ ] Implement skip links to main content
- [ ] Add ARIA landmarks (main, nav, footer, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure proper document title updates
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements

### Forms and Inputs
- [ ] Update all form fields with proper labels
- [ ] Implement accessible error handling
- [ ] Add descriptive help text
- [ ] Ensure form validation is accessible
- [ ] Test all forms with keyboard only

### Dynamic Content
- [ ] Implement ARIA live regions for announcements
- [ ] Add focus management for modals
- [ ] Make notifications accessible
- [ ] Ensure loading states are properly announced
- [ ] Test all dynamic content with screen readers

### Visual Design
- [ ] Audit and fix color contrast issues
- [ ] Ensure text can be resized up to 200%
- [ ] Add visible focus indicators
- [ ] Provide alternative cues for color-based information
- [ ] Test with color blindness simulators

### Media and Rich Content
- [ ] Add alt text to all images
- [ ] Ensure charts and graphs have accessible alternatives
- [ ] Make any video content accessible with captions
- [ ] Ensure interactive elements are keyboard accessible

## Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (1-2 weeks)

### Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Run automated tests on all pages
- [ ] Perform manual keyboard navigation testing
- [ ] Test with multiple screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS)
- [ ] Test on mobile screen readers (VoiceOver iOS, TalkBack)
- [ ] Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance using checklist

### User Testing
- [ ] Conduct testing with users who rely on assistive technology
- [ ] Document feedback and prioritize fixes
- [ ] Make necessary adjustments based on user feedback
- [ ] Retest with the same users after fixes

### Documentation
- [ ] Create accessibility statement
- [ ] Document known issues and workarounds
- [ ] Provide alternative contact methods
- [ ] Create developer guidelines for maintaining accessibility

## Phase 4: Ongoing Maintenance

### Process Integration
- [ ] Include accessibility checks in code review process
- [ ] Require accessibility testing for new features
- [ ] Add accessibility checks to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Schedule regular audits (quarterly)

### Training
- [ ] Train development team on accessibility principles
- [ ] Create component library with accessible patterns
- [ ] Document best practices for accessibility
- [ ] Share knowledge across teams
