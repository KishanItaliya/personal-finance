# Cursor Rules for Personal Finance Dashboard

This directory contains rules and configurations for Cursor to improve your prompt writing experience when working on the Personal Finance Dashboard project.

## What are Cursor Rules?

Cursor rules provide default instructions that are automatically included with every prompt you send to the AI assistant. This means you don't need to repeat common instructions or project context in each prompt.

## How to Use

1. The rules are automatically applied when you use Cursor with this project
2. You can still override any rule by explicitly stating different instructions in your prompt
3. Update `rules.json` to modify existing rules or add new ones

## Current Rules

The `rules.json` file contains several categories of rules:
- Project overview and context
- Code style guidelines
- Preferred libraries and frameworks
- Response format preferences
- File structure conventions
- Testing approaches
- Commit guidelines
- Error handling practices
- API integration patterns
- State management preferences
- Accessibility requirements
- Performance considerations

## Custom Rules

Feel free to customize the rules to better fit your workflow by editing the `rules.json` file.
